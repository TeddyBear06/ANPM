# ANPM
Fast, free and secure passwords generator.

Generate a password is a pain. Two main options for us, use the same password everywhere or generate random passwords that we forget as fast as we generate them.

First, you can watch this [super funny video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJ-NSPES9Y) about passwords ;-) 

ANPM allow you to freely generate secure passwords that you'll never forget again.

## 1. Tell to ANPM for wich platform you want to generate the password.

For example, you want a password for YouTube, just type in "youtube", or "YouTube" or even "YouTube.com" you decide. ANd this is the specificity of ANPM, your naming conventions freedom.

## 2. Type in your "Master key"

A "Master key" will be the only password that you need to save deeply into your brain :-) This "Master key" can be whatever you want. Even a small one will produce a crazy long password.

## 3. Type in a PIN

A PIN is a 4 digits password. I've added it to ensure that it will be more difficult to guess your generated password. For exemple, if 1 billion people use ANPM, a lot of them will probably use "youtube.com" as platform name, and probably something like "azerty" for password. Assuming that, the generated password will be easier to guess because it will be the same for a lot of people.

## 4. Enjoy your generated password

Hidden be default, you can unveil it and also play a little bit with it. You can remove special caracters if it's needed by the platform on wich you want to register. You can also remove uppercase letters.

That's all :-D I hope you'll enjoy it.
